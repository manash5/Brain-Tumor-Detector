# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using CNN and Transfer Learning

## 📖 Project Overview
This project implements a robust **Brain Tumor Detection System** designed to classify brain MRI scans into four categories: **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, **Pituitary Tumor**, and **No Tumor**. The core of the system is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that leverages **Transfer Learning** from the pre-trained **VGG16** model.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Multi-class Classification** (4 tumor categories)
- 🧠 **Transfer Learning** with VGG16 architecture
- 📊 **Data Augmentation** for improved generalization
- 📈 **Performance Metrics** (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- 💾 **Model Saving/Loading** capabilities

## 🗂️ Dataset
The model is trained and evaluated on the **"Brain Tumor MRI Dataset"** curated by Masoud Nickparvar.

### 🔗 Dataset Source
[**Kaggle: Brain Tumor MRI Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)

### 📁 Dataset Contents
The dataset contains **over 7,000 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI images**, categorized into four folders:

- `glioma_tumor/`
- `meningioma_tumor/` 
- `pituitary_tumor/`
- `no_tumor/`
